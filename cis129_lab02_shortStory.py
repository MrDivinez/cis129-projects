print('Until..'),
print('One day while he was traveling in the Bahamas, he met this girl who loved traveling, but wanted to explore more.'),
print('So he decided to take her out on a date, and things went very well, they found a lot of things they liked about each other and ended up traveling together'),
print('Throughout those journeys, they both fell in love and got married in France, where the city of love was met with two couples exploring the world to find each other')
